### Application Flow

Should we do it like Kahoot?

Let me elaborate

- One website for creating a game and one for directly playing the game
  - The website where u create the game will be a _normal_ website where u have a landing page etc. and can create account, see bills, and change subscription etc.
  - The other site is for playing the game directly by inserting something like a _Game PIN_ and choosing an appropiate username for the game
- The creator of the game should maybe
  - have the opportunity to either select random movies or select ones he wants us to use.
  - insert memes himself or let AI do it based on the movie titles
  - same goes for audio (this part is probably hard regarding automatically finding out some audio for a given movie)
  - have a way to configure how many tries the users can guess
  - definitely have the ability to choose between emojis or images maybe more opportunities here...
- There should be rounds just like in Kahoot
  - In each round depending on stuff like how long did it take to answer, correctness of the answer (see next point under sections), and maybe some other stuff...
  - See winners in a table (highscore something)
- The user (i.e. the ones who are playing) writes in an input field what his guess is.
  - To this I have thought that either we can do
    - Accept like 1 or 2 characters are wrong and still accept the answer
    - Use some kind of AI to match the relatedness to the input to the actual answer and then have a threshold like 95% correct then accepted otherwise reject
- The user can maybe use her or his voice to make an answer (imagine the chaos if it is in a drunk environment LMAO) and then we use voice-to-text
- Tournaments with a price?
  - Maybe in different categories? Science fiction etc.
- You vs. a bot
  - Play against a bot
  - Gamble against a bot make a wager and win and earn money
- If in a drunk environment maybe make the creator of the game turn on party mode i.e. disco lights when playing XD
- Drunk environment again omfg :D but after each round make the game decide either how much to drink or some fun challenges (maybe AI generated as well LOL)
